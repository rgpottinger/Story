Zaphod Beeblebrox, the three-armed, two-headed, impetuous President of the Imperial Galactic Government, a position that is described in a long footnote as being entirely ceremonial, races across the planet Damogran in a speedboat heading for a ceremony where he will ceremoniously reveal the new, sleek starship the Heart of Gold, named such as it contains a special golden box at its center. Zaphod performs his job well due to his flashy character and ability to attract attention to himself, which is exactly how he approaches the platform filled with cameras and a crowd of people who are waiting for him to reveal the Heart of Gold to the galaxy

On the platform, Zaphod ignores the speech given in his honor but says hello to Trillian, a petite, dark-haired humanoid who Zaphod picked up on a small planet. The speech over, Zaphod dismissively greets the crowd and flicks a switch that opens a large dome, revealing the Heart of Gold. Only moments later, Zaphod winks at Trillian and boldly informs his galaxy-wide audience that he plans to steal the Heart of Gold. Zaphod then lets out a triumphant “Whoop!” as he drops a Paralyso-Matic bomb, which freezes the crowd in place.
