As Arthur struggles to finish his third pint, he hears the crash of the bulldozer knocking down his house. Arthur runs out of the bar screaming, and Ford follows him, knowing that a Vogon Constructor fleet is descending on the planet. Arthur shouts for the construction crew to stop and stumbles to the ground, finally seeing the giant yellow starships descending from the sky. 

The Earth suddenly becomes silent as the Vogon fleet hangs in the air. Without warning, every audio device on the planet transmits the voice of Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace Planning Council bureaucratically informing the people of Earth that their planet has been scheduled for demolition to make way for a hyperspatial express route. The impassive voice announces that the process will only take two Earth minutes. Panic ensues, and, annoyed, Jeltz suggests that since the plans have been available for viewing for the past fifty years on Alpha Centauri, which is only four light-years away, the people have no right to act surprised. After conferring with someone on Earth, Jeltz orders his men to destroy the planet.
