Ford and Arthur are now in the pub known as the Horse and Groom. As Ford orders six pints of beer, he begins talking to the friendly bartender and suggests that the Earth will be ending in ten minutes. He then encourages Arthur to drink up his three pints quickly, as the alcohol will act as a muscle relaxant. When Arthur begins to question him, Ford reveals his true origins, explaining that he is really from a planet near Betelgeuse. Arthur is incredulous. Ford then announces that the world is about to end, which elicits an awkward moment between Arthur and the rest of the pub that ends with Arthur lamenting over his inability to deal with Thursdays.
